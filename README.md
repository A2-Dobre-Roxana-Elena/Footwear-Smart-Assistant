# Footwear-Smart-Assistant
"Footwear Smart Assistant" is an innovative project aimed at developing a footwear website that provides personalized recommendations to users. Emphasizing individual preferences, the current season, and fashion trends, this project delivers suggestions through email and an application. Within this effort, I actively contributed to team organization and shaping the concept. I played a key role in creating and developing essential pages such as Home, Season, Brand, Fashion Style, Statistics, Product Page, and User Account, thus ensuring a comprehensive and personalized user experience.
