# Footwear-Smart-Assistant
Footwear Smart Assistant" is an innovative project developed as part of the second-year Web Development course in the Computer Science program. This project is dedicated to creating a footwear website that offers personalized recommendations to users. It places a strong emphasis on individual preferences, the current season, and fashion trends, delivering suggestions through both email and a dedicated application. Within this project, I actively contributed to team organization and played a key role in shaping the concept. I was part of a two-person team and was responsible for creating and developing essential pages, including 'Acasa', 'Sezon', 'Brand','Stil Vestimenta', 'Statistici', 'Pagina Produs', 'AboutSec', 'HelpSec' and 'Cont Utilizator', ensuring a comprehensive and personalized user experience.
